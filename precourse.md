1.   If you do not already have an Uppmax account, create and Uppmax account following these [instructions](files/Apply_for_Uppmax_account.pdf). OBS! It may take a few days to recieve the account, so proceed with this point as soon as possible.

2.   Log in to SUPR and request membership in the project g2019002. Account approval requires manual confirmation from the course organizers, so it may not happen immediately. 

3.   Make sure you can connect to Rackham at Uppmax using a terminal. If you use a pc we recommend MobaXterm (http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) or Windows 10 Bash for Linux. 

4.   If you still feel uncertain how to work in a terminal please take time to do the first three parts in the “Unix tutorial for beginners” that can be found here http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/ before the course starts. Otherwise you will not be able to take in the practical parts.  

5.   Make sure that you can read and write in the course folder by creating a file with your uppmax user name in the `/proj/g2019002/completed` folder. If you cannot write to the folder, the most likely reason is that you have not requested access to the course project via [SUPR](https://supr.snic.se/), see point 2. OBS! It may take an hour or so from the time your access is approved before you can actually write to the folder. We will check before the course that all students have logged in and done this, so do not forget!

6.  Install R on your own computer, instructions can be found [here](https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/r_programming/1703/precourse).  

7.  Install Rstudio on your own computer to run all your commands (This is optional). Rstudio is a very powerful GUI for structuring your R code in a good way.

8.  If you feel that you need to touch up on your R-skills before the course start, we recommend that you go through some basic tutorials before the course starts. A list of useful tutorials can be found [here](https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/r_programming/1703/precourse).

9.  In R install the programs listed below. We will work with several R programs during the course and it takes a while to install so if you can do it before you will not have to waste time installing during the exercise time.
