This will help you to develop your programming skills and we can always learn a few tricks here and there, even if you are already experienced.\n\n- UNIX: [Part 1](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [Part 2](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras/)\n- R: [Part 1](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/), [Part 2](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)\n- Python: [Part 1](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/), [Part 2](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)\n\nAfter taking those courses (or any other equivalent course in programming in bash and R or Python), you should be familiar with\n\n- File structure and manipulation in bash\n- Loading, handling and manipulating vectors, matrices, factors and lists\n- Creating for-loops\n- Using Rmarkdown/Jupyter for reports\n- Editing and writing files in the command line\n- And much more ...\n\n## {{< fa brands slack >}} Slack\n\nWe will use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for communication, troubleshooting and group discussions. Please install [**Slack**](https://slack.com/intl/en-se/downloads). All accepted students will receive an invitation link via email to join the course workspace. Please add this workspace to your Slack application on your desktop rather than using it in the browser.\n\nOnce you are in the workspace, please join the following channels:\n\n- `#software-to-install` for questions about installation and troubleshooting\n- `#general` for general questions about the workshop\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nPlease post your question in the channel and **NOT** directly to the teacher. Any participant that knows the answer to any problem is encouraged to help too.\n:::\n\n## {{< fa server >}} Uppmax\n\nWe will use the high performance computing cluster (HPC) UPPMAX for the workshop. You will need to create accounts if you don't already have one. And you will need to join the course projects. See instructions [here](other/uppmax.qmd).\n\n## {{< fa brands docker >}} Docker\n\nIf you use Uppmax, you do not need any local installation or setup on your system. If you use Docker, you will need to set up and run Docker yourself. Instructions are [here](other/docker.qmd).\n\n## {{< fa circle-question >}} FAQ\n\nPlease refer to the [FAQ](other/faq.html) for troubleshooting common issues.\n",
